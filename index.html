            <h2>Make Hangouts into easily-reusable online meeting rooms.</h2>
            <p>We want to experiment this year with a number of different ways to advance ideas, i.e. to put Ideas in Action. We have the opportunity to try an interesting new format - virtual conversations using the Unhangout Platform. We are inviting some of our speakers to be hosts of virtual discussion rooms on Feb 12. On the day of the event, there will be a kick-off webinar, after which people will proceed to the session they are interested in. In the individual discussion room, participants will hear from a speaker, view a TEDxBeaconStreet talk and discuss it. We hope this catalyzes interest, ideas, and the potential for follow-up to help advance the idea.</p>
