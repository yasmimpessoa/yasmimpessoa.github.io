    <!-- My idea is to create boxes on my homepage with sections of my works. I would like to have something prettier and with a little more space, maybe with these sections spread all over the page or centered in the middle. I am also trying to find a way to make the words visually pretty. I want to create icons on Photoshop to substitute the words, and make them become clickable images. I think it is visually better. -->
