            <p>I have a couple of blogs where I publish my experiences, thoughts and works since I arrived at University of Florida.</p>

<li>I have just started <a href="http://audiovisualstories.wordpress.com/">Audiovisual Stories</a>, a wordpress blog where I will talk about my relationship with audiovisual, such as videos, films and other types of moving images.</li>
<li>I have a blogspot called <a href="http://thestorytellerjourney.blogspot.com/">The Journey of a New Storyteller</a>. I will post weekly about my experiences in the United States, and related it to what I have been learning so far since I got here.</li>
