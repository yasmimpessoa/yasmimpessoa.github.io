                <li><h3>Jerry Rose, an artist from the community</h3>

Jerry Rose is an 80 year-old actor, director and vice president of the Acrosstown Repertory Theatre, a community theatre based in Gainesville, Florida. During Halloween, he directed the show Fright Night, based on three classical horror short stories, The Tell Tale Heart and Masque of the Red Death by Edgar Allan Poe, and The Monkeyâ€™s Paw by W.W. Jacobs. I had the great pleasure to sit and talk to him and see him in action. This <a href="http://plaza.ufl.edu/yasmimpessoa/publish_to_web/soundslide">soundslide</a> tells us a little of his story, a man devoted to community theatre.

                <h3>Pezinho de Jatoba</h3>

Pezinho de Jatoba is a project interested in developing audiovisual activities in Shangri-la, a poor neighborhood in Goiania, Brazil. This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q8fuaCNmT4">slideshow</a> is a sequence of photos I took while a little girl was showing me where she lives. I spent a few  months regularly going to this neighborhood and helping organizing screenings and other activities with children there. I had the chance to interact with people, listen and share thoughts and talents. It was a unique time.</li> </p>
