            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>A 20 year-old student at University of Florida crazy about images, texts, sounds, performing arts and storytelling.</p>
                <p><img src="img/yasmim.JPG" width="100" title="yaasmim" alt="yasmim"/> </p>
            <p> Born and raised in Brazil, Iâ€™m living a unique 1-year exchange experience in the United States as a fully funded scholarship recipient, and growing better while learning to communicate in another language, living in another culture and celebrating life in every single moment. </p>
            <p>This new experience is definitely enhancing the skills every communicator should have, like an open-mind, resilience, independence and creativeness.</p>
